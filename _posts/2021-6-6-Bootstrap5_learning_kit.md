### [Bootstrap 5 Learning Kit](https://monadwizard.github.io/bootstrap5_practrice/)

Welcome to this custom made Bootstrap 5 Learning Kit. This is specifically created for the online course Master Bootstrap 5 by Frontend Workshop.

This learning kit consists of the following three sections:

-   Reference: <br>
    This section features all the examples complete with code with syntax highlighting, copy-to-clipboard functionality and direct export to CodePen.

-   Practice: <br>
    This section features basic HTML elements and content for all the examples, but without any specific Bootstrap classes or attributes. A great way to practice and memorize the various elements of Bootstrap.

-   Screencast: <br>
    This section is the starting point for all the video lectures, which are mostly screencasts with all examples coded from scratch. A great way to learn while following along with the course.

Choose a topic from the dropdown menu. You'll then go to that topic's reference page. From there you can toggle between the three different views: reference, practice and screencast.

At anytime you can go to another topic from the dropdown menu.
