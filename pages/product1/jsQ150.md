## 101. What's the value of output?

```javascript
const one = false || {} || null;
const two = null || false || '';
const three = [] || 0 || true;

console.log(one, two, three);
```

- A: `false` `null` `[]`
- B: `null` `""` `true`
- C: `{}` `""` `[]`
- D: `null` `null` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

With the `||` operator, we can return the first truthy operand. If all values are falsy, the last operand gets returned.

`(false || {} || null)`: the empty object `{}` is a truthy value. This is the first (and only) truthy value, which gets returned. `one` is equal to `{}`.

`(null || false || "")`: all operands are falsy values. This means that the last operand, `""` gets returned. `two` is equal to `""`.

`([] || 0 || "")`: the empty array`[]` is a truthy value. This is the first truthy value, which gets returned. `three` is equal to `[]`.

## 102. What's the value of output?

```javascript
const myPromise = () => Promise.resolve('I have resolved!');

function firstFunction() {
  myPromise().then(res => console.log(res));
  console.log('second');
}

async function secondFunction() {
  console.log(await myPromise());
  console.log('second');
}

firstFunction();
secondFunction();
```

- A: `I have resolved!`, `second` and `I have resolved!`, `second`
- B: `second`, `I have resolved!` and `second`, `I have resolved!`
- C: `I have resolved!`, `second` and `second`, `I have resolved!`
- D: `second`, `I have resolved!` and `I have resolved!`, `second`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: D

With a promise, we basically say _I want to execute this function, but I'll put it aside for now while it's running since this might take a while. Only when a certain value is resolved (or rejected), and when the call stack is empty, I want to use this value._

We can get this value with both `.then` and the `await` keyword in an `async` function. Although we can get a promise's value with both `.then` and `await`, they work a bit differently.

In the `firstFunction`, we (sort of) put the myPromise function aside while it was running, but continued running the other code, which is `console.log('second')` in this case. Then, the function resolved with the string `I have resolved`, which then got logged after it saw that the callstack was empty.

With the await keyword in `secondFunction`, we literally pause the execution of an async function until the value has been resolved before moving to the next line.

This means that it waited for the `myPromise` to resolve with the value `I have resolved`, and only once that happened, we moved to the next line: `second` got logged.

## 103. What's the value of output?

```javascript
const set = new Set();

set.add(1);
set.add('Lydia');
set.add({ name: 'Lydia' });

for (let item of set) {
  console.log(item + 2);
}
```

- A: `3`, `NaN`, `NaN`
- B: `3`, `7`, `NaN`
- C: `3`, `Lydia2`, `[object Object]2`
- D: `"12"`, `Lydia2`, `[object Object]2`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

The `+` operator is not only used for adding numerical values, but we can also use it to concatenate strings. Whenever the JavaScript engine sees that one or more values are not a number, it coerces the number into a string.

The first one is `1`, which is a numerical value. `1 + 2` returns the number 3.

However, the second one is a string `"Lydia"`. `"Lydia"` is a string and `2` is a number: `2` gets coerced into a string. `"Lydia"` and `"2"` get concatenated, which results in the string `"Lydia2"`.

`{ name: "Lydia" }` is an object. Neither a number nor an object is a string, so it stringifies both. Whenever we stringify a regular object, it becomes `"[object Object]"`. `"[object Object]"` concatenated with `"2"` becomes `"[object Object]2"`.

## 104. What's its value?

```javascript
Promise.resolve(5);
```

- A: `5`
- B: `Promise {<pending>: 5}`
- C: `Promise¬†{<fulfilled>: 5}`
- D: `Error`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

We can pass any type of value we want to `Promise.resolve`, either a promise or a non-promise. The method itself returns a promise with the resolved value (`<fulfilled>`). If you pass a regular function, it'll be a resolved promise with a regular value. If you pass a promise, it'll be a resolved promise with the resolved value of that passed promise.

In this case, we just passed the numerical value `5`. It returns a resolved promise with the value `5`.

## 105. What's its value?

```javascript
function compareMembers(person1, person2 = person) {
  if (person1 !== person2) {
    console.log('Not the same!');
  } else {
    console.log('They are the same!');
  }
}

const person = { name: 'Lydia' };

compareMembers(person);
```

- A: `Not the same!`
- B: `They are the same!`
- C: `ReferenceError`
- D: `SyntaxError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: B

Objects are passed by reference. When we check objects for strict equality (`===`), we're comparing their references.

We set the default value for `person2` equal to the `person` object, and passed the `person` object as the value for `person1`.

This means that both values have a reference to the same spot in memory, thus they are equal.

The code block in the `else` statement gets run, and `They are the same!` gets logged.

</p>

## 106. What's its value?

```javascript
const colorConfig = {
  red: true,
  blue: false,
  green: true,
  black: true,
  yellow: false,
};

const colors = ['pink', 'red', 'blue'];

console.log(colorConfig.colors[1]);
```

- A: `true`
- B: `false`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: D

In JavaScript, we have two ways to access properties on an object: bracket notation, or dot notation. In this example, we use dot notation (`colorConfig.colors`) instead of bracket notation (`colorConfig["colors"]`).

With dot notation, JavaScript tries to find the property on the object with that exact name. In this example, JavaScript tries to find a property called `colors` on the `colorConfig` object. There is no property called `colors`, so this returns `undefined`. Then, we try to access the value of the first element by using `[1]`. We cannot do this on a value that's `undefined`, so it throws a `TypeError`: `Cannot read property '1' of undefined`.

JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket `[` and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket `]`. Only then, it will evaluate the statement. If we would've used `colorConfig[colors[1]]`, it would have returned the value of the `red` property on the `colorConfig` object.

## 107. What's its value?

```javascript
console.log('‚ù§Ô∏è' === '‚ù§Ô∏è');
```

- A: `true`
- B: `false`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: A

Under the hood, emojis are unicodes. The unicodes for the heart emoji is `"U+2764 U+FE0F"`. These are always the same for the same emojis, so we're comparing two equal strings to each other, which returns true.

</p>
</details>

---

## 108. Which of these methods modifies the original array?

```javascript
const emojis = ['‚ú®', 'ü•ë', 'üòç'];

emojis.map(x => x + '‚ú®');
emojis.filter(x => x !== 'ü•ë');
emojis.find(x => x !== 'ü•ë');
emojis.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + '‚ú®');
emojis.slice(1, 2, '‚ú®');
emojis.splice(1, 2, '‚ú®');
```

- A: `All of them`
- B: `map` `reduce` `slice` `splice`
- C: `map` `slice` `splice`
- D: `splice`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: D

With `splice` method, we modify the original array by deleting, replacing or adding elements. In this case, we removed 2 items from index 1 (we removed `'ü•ë'` and `'üòç'`) and added the ‚ú® emoji instead.

`map`, `filter` and `slice` return a new array, `find` returns an element, and `reduce` returns a reduced value.

</p>
</details>

---

## 109. What's the output?

```javascript
const food = ['üçï', 'üç´', 'ü•ë', 'üçî'];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };

info.favoriteFood = 'üçù';

console.log(food);
```

- A: `['üçï', 'üç´', 'ü•ë', 'üçî']`
- B: `['üçù', 'üç´', 'ü•ë', 'üçî']`
- C: `['üçù', 'üçï', 'üç´', 'ü•ë', 'üçî']`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: A

We set the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object equal to the string with the pizza emoji, `'üçï'`. A string is a primitive data type. In JavaScript, primitive data types don't interact by reference.

In JavaScript, primitive data types (everything that's not an object) interact by _value_. In this case, we set the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object equal to the value of the first element in the `food` array, the string with the pizza emoji in this case (`'üçï'`). A string is a primitive data type, and interact by value (see my [blogpost](https://www.theavocoder.com/complete-javascript/2018/12/21/by-value-vs-by-reference) if you're interested in learning more)

Then, we change the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object. The `food` array hasn't changed, since the value of `favoriteFood` was merely a _copy_ of the value of the first element in the array, and doesn't have a reference to the same spot in memory as the element on `food[0]`. When we log food, it's still the original array, `['üçï', 'üç´', 'ü•ë', 'üçî']`.

## 110. What does this method do?

```javascript
JSON.parse();
```

- A: Parses JSON to a JavaScript value
- B: Parses a JavaScript object to JSON
- C: Parses any JavaScript value to JSON
- D: Parses JSON to a JavaScript object only

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: A

With the `JSON.parse()` method, we can parse JSON string to a JavaScript value.

```javascript
// Stringifying a number into valid JSON, then parsing the JSON string to a JavaScript value:
const jsonNumber = JSON.stringify(4); // '4'
JSON.parse(jsonNumber); // 4

// Stringifying an array value into valid JSON, then parsing the JSON string to a JavaScript value:
const jsonArray = JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3]); // '[1, 2, 3]'
JSON.parse(jsonArray); // [1, 2, 3]

// Stringifying an object  into valid JSON, then parsing the JSON string to a JavaScript value:
const jsonArray = JSON.stringify({ name: 'Lydia' }); // '{"name":"Lydia"}'
JSON.parse(jsonArray); // { name: 'Lydia' }
```

</p>

## 111. What's the output?

```javascript
let name = 'Lydia';

function getName() {
  console.log(name);
  let name = 'Sarah';
}

getName();
```

- A: Lydia
- B: Sarah
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: D

Each function has its own _execution context_ (or _scope_). The `getName` function first looks within its own context (scope) to see if it contains the variable `name` we're trying to access. In this case, the `getName` function contains its own `name` variable: we declare the variable `name` with the `let` keyword, and with the value of `'Sarah'`.

Variables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get <i>initialized</i>. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the "temporal dead zone". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`.

If we wouldn't have declared the `name` variable within the `getName` function, the javascript engine would've looked down the _scope chain_. The outer scope has a variable called `name` with the value of `Lydia`. In that case, it would've logged `Lydia`.

```javascript
let name = 'Lydia';

function getName() {
  console.log(name);
}

getName(); // Lydia
```

## 112. What's the output?

```javascript
function* generatorOne() {
  yield ['a', 'b', 'c'];
}

function* generatorTwo() {
  yield* ['a', 'b', 'c'];
}

const one = generatorOne();
const two = generatorTwo();

console.log(one.next().value);
console.log(two.next().value);
```

- A: `a` and `a`
- B: `a` and `undefined`
- C: `['a', 'b', 'c']` and `a`
- D: `a` and `['a', 'b', 'c']`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

With the `yield` keyword, we `yield` values in a generator function. With the `yield*` keyword, we can yield values from another generator function, or iterable object (for example an array).

In `generatorOne`, we yield the entire array `['a', 'b', 'c']` using the `yield` keyword. The value of `value` property on the object returned by the `next` method on `one` (`one.next().value`) is equal to the entire array `['a', 'b', 'c']`.

```javascript
console.log(one.next().value); // ['a', 'b', 'c']
console.log(one.next().value); // undefined
```

In `generatorTwo`, we use the `yield*` keyword. This means that the first yielded value of `two`, is equal to the first yielded value in the iterator. The iterator is the array `['a', 'b', 'c']`. The first yielded value is `a`, so the first time we call `two.next().value`, `a` is returned.

```javascript
console.log(two.next().value); // 'a'
console.log(two.next().value); // 'b'
console.log(two.next().value); // 'c'
console.log(two.next().value); // undefined
```

## 113. What's the output?

```javascript
console.log(`${(x => x)('I love')} to program`);
```

- A: `I love to program`
- B: `undefined to program`
- C: `${(x => x)('I love') to program`
- D: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: A

Expressions within template literals are evaluated first. This means that the string will contain the returned value of the expression, the immediately invoked function `(x => x)('I love')` in this case. We pass the value `'I love'` as an argument to the `x => x` arrow function. `x` is equal to `'I love'`, which gets returned. This results in `I love to program`.

## 114. What will happen?

```javascript
let config = {
  alert: setInterval(() => {
    console.log('Alert!');
  }, 1000),
};

config = null;
```

- A: The `setInterval` callback won't be invoked
- B: The `setInterval` callback gets invoked once
- C: The `setInterval` callback will still be called every second
- D: We never invoked `config.alert()`, config is `null`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

Normally when we set objects equal to `null`, those objects get _garbage collected_ as there is no reference anymore to that object. However, since the callback function within `setInterval` is an arrow function (thus bound to the `config` object), the callback function still holds a reference to the `config` object. As long as there is a reference, the object won't get garbage collected. Since it's not garbage collected, the `setInterval` callback function will still get invoked every 1000ms (1s).

</p>

## 115. Which method(s) will return the value `'Hello world!'`?

```javascript
const myMap = new Map();
const myFunc = () => 'greeting';

myMap.set(myFunc, 'Hello world!');

//1
myMap.get('greeting');
//2
myMap.get(myFunc);
//3
myMap.get(() => 'greeting');
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 2 and 3
- D: All of them

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: B

When adding a key/value pair using the `set` method, the key will be the value of the first argument passed to the `set` function, and the value will be the second argument passed to the `set` function. The key is the _function_ `() => 'greeting'` in this case, and the value `'Hello world'`. `myMap` is now `{ () => 'greeting' => 'Hello world!' }`.

1 is wrong, since the key is not `'greeting'` but `() => 'greeting'`.
3 is wrong, since we're creating a new function by passing it as a parameter to the `get` method. Object interact by _reference_. Functions are objects, which is why two functions are never strictly equal, even if they are identical: they have a reference to a different spot in memory.

</p>
</details>

## 116. What's the output?

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Lydia',
  age: 21,
};

const changeAge = (x = { ...person }) => (x.age += 1);
const changeAgeAndName = (x = { ...person }) => {
  x.age += 1;
  x.name = 'Sarah';
};

changeAge(person);
changeAgeAndName();

console.log(person);
```

- A: `{name: "Sarah", age: 22}`
- B: `{name: "Sarah", age: 23}`
- C: `{name: "Lydia", age: 22}`
- D: `{name: "Lydia", age: 23}`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

Both the `changeAge` and `changeAgeAndName` functions have a default parameter, namely a _newly_ created object `{ ...person }`. This object has copies of all the key/values in the `person` object.

First, we invoke the `changeAge` function and pass the `person` object as its argument. This function increases the value of the `age` property by 1. `person` is now `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`.

Then, we invoke the `changeAgeAndName` function, however we don't pass a parameter. Instead, the value of `x` is equal to a _new_ object: `{ ...person }`. Since it's a new object, it doesn't affect the values of the properties on the `person` object. `person` is still equal to `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`.

</p>
</details>

## 117. Which of the following options will return `6`?

```javascript
function sumValues(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}
```

- A: `sumValues([...1, 2, 3])`
- B: `sumValues([...[1, 2, 3]])`
- C: `sumValues(...[1, 2, 3])`
- D: `sumValues([1, 2, 3])`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

With the spread operator `...`, we can _spread_ iterables to individual elements. The `sumValues` function receives three arguments: `x`, `y` and `z`. `...[1, 2, 3]` will result in `1, 2, 3`, which we pass to the `sumValues` function.

</p>
</details>

## 118. What's the output?

```javascript
let num = 1;
const list = ['ü•≥', 'ü§†', 'ü•∞', 'ü§™'];

console.log(list[(num += 1)]);
```

- A: `ü§†`
- B: `ü•∞`
- C: `SyntaxError`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: B

With the `+=` operand, we're incrementing the value of `num` by `1`. `num` had the initial value `1`, so `1 + 1` is `2`. The item on the second index in the `list` array is ü•∞, `console.log(list[2])` prints ü•∞.

</p>
</details>

## 119. What's the output?

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: 'Lydia',
  lastName: 'Hallie',
  pet: {
    name: 'Mara',
    breed: 'Dutch Tulip Hound',
  },
  getFullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
};

console.log(person.pet?.name);
console.log(person.pet?.family?.name);
console.log(person.getFullName?.());
console.log(member.getLastName?.());
```

- A: `undefined` `undefined` `undefined` `undefined`
- B: `Mara` `undefined` `Lydia Hallie` `ReferenceError`
- C: `Mara` `null` `Lydia Hallie` `null`
- D: `null` `ReferenceError` `null` `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: B

With the optional chaining operator `?.`, we no longer have to explicitly check whether the deeper nested values are valid or not. If we're trying to access a property on an `undefined` or `null` value (_nullish_), the expression short-circuits and returns `undefined`.

`person.pet?.name`: `person` has a property named `pet`: `person.pet` is not nullish. It has a property called `name`, and returns `Mara`.
`person.pet?.family?.name`: `person` has a property named `pet`: `person.pet` is not nullish. `pet` does _not_ have a property called `family`, `person.pet.family` is nullish. The expression returns `undefined`.
`person.getFullName?.()`: `person` has a property named `getFullName`: `person.getFullName()` is not nullish and can get invoked, which returns `Lydia Hallie`.
`member.getLastName?.()`: `member` is not defined: `member.getLastName()` is nullish. The expression returns `undefined`.

## 120. What's the output?

```javascript
const groceries = ['banana', 'apple', 'peanuts'];

if (groceries.indexOf('banana')) {
  console.log('We have to buy bananas!');
} else {
  console.log(`We don't have to buy bananas!`);
}
```

- A: We have to buy bananas!
- B: We don't have to buy bananas
- C: `undefined`
- D: `1`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: B

We passed the condition `groceries.indexOf("banana")` to the if-statement. `groceries.indexOf("banana")` returns `0`, which is a falsy value. Since the condition in the if-statement is falsy, the code in the `else` block runs, and `We don't have to buy bananas!` gets logged.

</p>
</details>

## 121. What's the output?

```javascript
const config = {
  languages: [],
  set language(lang) {
    return this.languages.push(lang);
  },
};

console.log(config.language);
```

- A: `function language(lang) { this.languages.push(lang }`
- B: `0`
- C: `[]`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: D

The `language` method is a `setter`. Setters don't hold an actual value, their purpose is to _modify_ properties. When calling a `setter` method, `undefined` gets returned.

</p>
</details>

## 122. What's the output?

```javascript
const name = 'Lydia Hallie';

console.log(!typeof name === 'object');
console.log(!typeof name === 'string');
```

- A: `false` `true`
- B: `true` `false`
- C: `false` `false`
- D: `true` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

`typeof name` returns `"string"`. The string `"string"` is a truthy value, so `!typeof name` returns the boolean value `false`. `false === "object"` and `false === "string"` both return`false`.

(If we wanted to check whether the type was (un)equal to a certain type, we should've written `!==` instead of `!typeof`)

</p>
</details>

## 123. What's the output?

```javascript
const add = x => y => z => {
  console.log(x, y, z);
  return x + y + z;
};

add(4)(5)(6);
```

- A: `4` `5` `6`
- B: `6` `5` `4`
- C: `4` `function` `function`
- D: `undefined` `undefined` `6`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: A

The `add` function returns an arrow function, which returns an arrow function, which returns an arrow function (still with me?). The first function receives an argument `x` with the value of `4`. We invoke the second function, which receives an argument `y` with the value `5`. Then we invoke the third function, which receives an argument `z` with the value `6`. When we're trying to access the value `x`, `y` and `z` within the last arrow function, the JS engine goes up the scope chain in order to find the values for `x` and `y` accordingly. This returns `4` `5` `6`.

## 124. What's the output?

```javascript
async function* range(start, end) {
  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    yield Promise.resolve(i);
  }
}

(async () => {
  const gen = range(1, 3);
  for await (const item of gen) {
    console.log(item);
  }
})();
```

- A: `Promise {1}` `Promise {2}` `Promise {3}`
- B: `Promise {<pending>}` `Promise {<pending>}` `Promise {<pending>}`
- C: `1` `2` `3`
- D: `undefined` `undefined` `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

The generator function `range` returns an async object with promises for each item in the range we pass: `Promise{1}`, `Promise{2}`, `Promise{3}`. We set the variable `gen` equal to the async object, after which we loop over it using a `for await ... of` loop. We set the variable `item` equal to the returned Promise values: first `Promise{1}`, then `Promise{2}`, then `Promise{3}`. Since we're _awaiting_ the value of `item`, the resolved promsie, the resolved _values_ of the promises get returned: `1`, `2`, then `3`.

## 125. What's the output?

```javascript
const myFunc = ({ x, y, z }) => {
  console.log(x, y, z);
};

myFunc(1, 2, 3);
```

- A: `1` `2` `3`
- B: `{1: 1}` `{2: 2}` `{3: 3}`
- C: `{ 1: undefined }` `undefined` `undefined`
- D: `undefined` `undefined` `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: D

`myFunc` expects an object with properties `x`, `y` and `z` as its argument. Since we're only passing three separate numeric values (1, 2, 3) instead of one object with properties `x`, `y` and `z` ({x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}), `x`, `y` and `z` have their default value of `undefined`.

  return `The driver drove ${formattedSpeed} and has to pay ${formattedAmount}`;
}

console.log(getFine(130, 300))
```

- A: The driver drove 130 and has to pay 300
- B: The driver drove 130 mph and has to pay \$300.00
- C: The driver drove undefined and has to pay undefined
- D: The driver drove 130.00 and has to pay 300.00

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: B

With the `Intl.NumberFormat` method, we can format numeric values to any locale. We format the numeric value `130` to the `en-US` locale as a `unit` in `mile-per-hour`, which results in `130 mph`. The numeric value `300` to the `en-US` locale as a `currency` in `USD` results in `$300.00`.

- C: `["üëª", "üéÉ", "üï∏", { item: "üíÄ" }]`
- D: `["üëª", "üéÉ", "üï∏", "[object Object]"]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: B

By destructuring objects, we can unpack values from the right-hand object, and assign the unpacked value to the value of the same property name on the left-hand object. In this case, we're assigning the value "üíÄ" to `spookyItems[3]`. This means that we're modifying the `spookyItems` array, we're adding the "üíÄ" to it. When logging `spookyItems`, `["üëª", "üéÉ", "üï∏", "üíÄ"]` gets logged.

- A: `true` `false` `true` `false`

- C: `false` `false` `true` `false`
- D: `false` `true` `false` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

With the `Number.isNaN` method, you can check if the value you pass is a _numeric value_ and equal to `NaN`. `name` is not a numeric value, so `Number.isNaN(name)` returns `false`. `age` is a numeric value, but is not equal to `NaN`, so `Number.isNaN(age)` returns `false`.

With the `isNaN` method, you can check if the value you pass is not a number. `name` is not a number, so `isNaN(name)` returns true. `age` is a number, so `isNaN(age)` returns `false`.

getInfo();
```

- A: `"number"`
- B: `"string"`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: D

Variables declared with the `const` keyword are not referencable before their initialization: this is called the _temporal dead zone_. In the `getInfo` function, the variable `randomValue` is scoped in the functional scope of `getInfo`. On the line where we want to log the value of `typeof randomValue`, the variable `randomValue` isn't initialized yet: a `ReferenceError` gets thrown! The engine didn't go down the scope chain since we declared the variable `randomValue` in the `getInfo` function.

- C: `Woah some cool data` `Oh finally!`
- D: `Oops didn't work` `Oh finally!`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

In the `try` block, we're logging the awaited value of the `myPromise` variable: `"Woah some cool data"`. Since no errors were thrown in the `try` block, the code in the `catch` block doesn't run. The code in the `finally` block _always_ runs, `"Oh finally!"` gets logged.

- D: `['ü•ë', '‚ú®', '‚ú®', 'üçï', 'üçï']`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: B

With the `flat` method, we can create a new, flattened array. The depth of the flattened array depends on the value that we pass. In this case, we passed the value `1` (which we didn't have to, that's the default value), meaning that only the arrays on the first depth will be concatenated. `['ü•ë']` and `['‚ú®', '‚ú®', ['üçï', 'üçï']]` in this case. Concatenating these two arrays results in `['ü•ë', '‚ú®', '‚ú®', ['üçï', 'üçï']]`.

```

- A: `0`
- B: `1`
- C: `2`
- D: `3`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: D

`counterOne` is an instance of the `Counter` class. The counter class contains a `count` property on its constructor, and an `increment` method. First, we invoked the `increment` method twice by calling `counterOne.increment()`. Currently, `counterOne.count` is `2`.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KxLlTm9.png" width="400">

Then, we create a new variable `counterTwo`, and set it equal to `counterOne`. Since objects interact by reference, we're just creating a new reference to the same spot in memory that `counterOne` points to. Since it has the same spot in memory, any changes made to the object that `counterTwo` has a reference to, also apply to `counterOne`. Currently, `counterTwo.count` is `2`.

We invoke the `counterTwo.increment()`, which sets the `count` to `3`. Then, we log the count on `counterOne`, which logs `3`.

- A: `Promise! Last line! Promise! Last line! Last line! Promise!`
- B: `Last line! Timeout! Promise! Last line! Timeout! Promise!`
- C: `Promise! Last line! Last line! Promise! Timeout! Timeout!`
- D: `Last line! Promise! Promise! Last line! Timeout! Timeout!`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: D

First, we invoke `funcOne`. On the first line of `funcOne`, we call the `myPromise` promise, which is an _asynchronous_ operation. While the engine is busy completing the promise, it keeps on running the function `funcOne`. The next line is the _asynchronous_ `setTimeout` function, from which the callback is sent to the Web API. (see my article on the event loop here.)

Both the promise and the timeout are asynchronous operations, the function keeps on running while it's busy completing the promise and handling the `setTimeout` callback. This means that `Last line!` gets logged first, since this is not an asynchonous operation. This is the last line of `funcOne`, the promise resolved, and `Promise!` gets logged. However, since we're invoking `funcTwo()`, the call stack isn't empty, and the callback of the `setTimeout` function cannot get added to the callstack yet.

In `funcTwo` we're, first _awaiting_ the myPromise promise. With the `await` keyword, we pause the execution of the function until the promise has resolved (or rejected). Then, we log the awaited value of `res` (since the promise itself returns a promise). This logs `Promise!`.

The next line is the _asynchronous_ `setTimeout` function, from which the callback is sent to the Web API.

We get to the last line of `funcTwo`, which logs `Last line!` to the console. Now, since `funcTwo` popped off the call stack, the call stack is empty. The callbacks waiting in the queue (`() => console.log("Timeout!")` from `funcOne`, and `() => console.log("Timeout!")` from `funcTwo`) get added to the call stack one by one. The first callback logs `Timeout!`, and gets popped off the stack. Then, the second callback logs `Timeout!`, and gets popped off the stack. This logs `Last line! Promise! Promise! Last line! Timeout! Timeout!`

## 134. How can we invoke `sum` in `index.js` from `sum.js?`

```javascript
// sum.js
export default function sum(x) {
  return x + x;
}

// index.js
import * as sum from './sum';
```

- A: `sum(4)`
- B: `sum.sum(4)`
- C: `sum.default(4)`
- D: Default aren't imported with `*`, only named exports

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

With the asterisk `*`, we import all exported values from that file, both default and named. If we had the following file:

```javascript
// info.js
export const name = 'Lydia';
export const age = 21;
export default 'I love JavaScript';

// index.js
import * as info from './info';
console.log(info);
```

The following would get logged:

```javascript
{
  default: "I love JavaScript",
  name: "Lydia",
  age: 21
}
```

For the `sum` example, it means that the imported value `sum` looks like this:

```javascript
{ default: function sum(x) { return x + x } }
```

We can invoke this function, by calling `sum.default`

## 135. What's the output?

  get: () => console.log('Accessed a property!'),
};

const person = new Proxy({}, handler);

person.name = 'Lydia';
person.name;
```

- A: `Added a new property!`
- B: `Accessed a property!`
- C: `Added a new property!` `Accessed a property!`
- D: Nothing gets logged

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

With a Proxy object, we can add custom behavior to an object that we pass to it as the second argument. In this case, we pass the `handler` object which contained to properties: `set` and `get`. `set` gets invoked whenever we _set_ property values, `get` gets invoked whenever we _get_ (access) property values.

The first argument is an empty object `{}`, which is the value of `person`. To this object, the custom behavior specified in the `handler` object gets added. If we add a property to the `person` object, `set` will get invoked. If we access a property on the `person` object, `get` gets invoked.

First, we added a new property `name` to the proxy object (`person.name = "Lydia"`). `set` gets invoked, and logs `"Added a new property!"`.

Then, we access a property value on the proxy object, the `get` property on the handler object got invoked. `"Accessed a property!"` gets logged.

- A: `person.name = "Evan Bacon"`

- C: `person.address.street = "101 Main St"`
- D: `person.pet = { name: "Mara" }`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

The `Object.freeze` method _freezes_ an object. No properties can be added, modified, or removed.

However, it only _shallowly_ freezes the object, meaning that only _direct_ properties on the object are frozen. If the property is another object, like `address` in this case, the properties on that object aren't frozen, and can be modified.

- C: `2` `Error` and `3` `6`
- D: `2` `4` and `3` `Error`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: A

First, we invoked `myFunc()` without passing any arguments. Since we didn't pass arguments, `num` and `value` got their default values: num is `2`, and `value` the returned value of the function `add`. To the `add` function, we pass `num` as an argument, which had the value of `2`. `add` returns `4`, which is the value of `value`.

Then, we invoked `myFunc(3)` and passed the value `3` as the value for the argument `num`. We didn't pass an argument for `value`. Since we didn't pass a value for the `value` argument, it got the default value: the returned value of the `add` function. To `add`, we pass `num`, which has the value of `3`. `add` returns `6`, which is the value of `value`.

- C: `return getMembers(teams[i].members)`
- D: `return yield getMembers(teams[i].members)`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

  Answer: B

In order to iterate over the `members` in each element in the `teams` array, we need to pass `teams[i].members` to the `getMembers` generator function. The generator function returns a generator object. In order to iterate over each element in this generator object, we need to use `yield*`.

If we would've written `yield`, `return yield`, or `return`, the entire generator function would've gotten returned the first time we called the `next` method.

- C: `["coding", "dancing", "baking"]`
- D: `["coding", "running", "dancing", "baking"]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

The `addHobby` function receives two arguments, `hobby` and `hobbies` with the default value of the `hobbies` array on the `person` object.

First, we invoke the `addHobby` function, and pass `"running"` as the value for `hobby` and an empty array as the value for `hobbies`. Since we pass an empty array as the value for `y`, `"running"` gets added to this empty array.

Then, we invoke the `addHobby` function, and pass `"dancing"` as the value for `hobby`. We didn't pass a value for `hobbies`, so it gets the default value, the `hobbies` property on the `person` object. We push the hobby `dancing` to the `person.hobbies` array.

Last, we invoke the `addHobby` function, and pass `"baking"` as the value for `hobby`, and the `person.hobbies` array as the value for `hobbies`. We push the hobby `baking` to the `person.hobbies` array.

After pushing `dancing` and `baking`, the value of `person.hobbies` is `["coding", "dancing", "baking"]`

- D: `*[Symbol.iterator]() { for (let x in this) yield this }`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

Objects aren't iterable by default. An iterable is an iterable if the iterator protocol is present. We can add this manually by adding the iterator symbol `[Symbol.iterator]`, which has to return a generator object, for example by making it a generator function `*[Symbol.iterator]() {}`. This generator function has to yield the `Object.values` of the `person` object if we want it to return the array `["Lydia Hallie", 21]`: `yield* Object.values(this)`.

- A: 1

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

The `if` condition within the `forEach` loop checks whether the value of `num` is truthy or falsy. Since the first number in the `nums` array is `0`, a falsy value, the `if` statement's code block won't be executed. `count` only gets incremented for the other 3 numbers in the `nums` array, `1`, `2` and `3`. Since `count` gets incremented by `1` 3 times, the value of `count` is `3`.

- C: `[]`, `[]`, üçå
- D: `undefined`, `undefined`, üçå

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: D

The `?` allows us to optionally access deeper nested properties within objects. We're trying to log the item on index `1` within the subarray that's on index `1` of the `fruits` array. If the subarray on index `1` in the `fruits` array doesn't exist, it'll simply return `undefined`. If the subarray on index `1` in the `fruits` array exists, but this subarray doesn't have an item on its `1` index, it'll also return `undefined`. 

First, we're trying to log the second item in the `['üçç']` subarray of `[['üçä', 'üçå'], ['üçç']]`. This subarray only contains one item, which means there is no item on index `1`, and returns `undefined`.

Then, we're invoking the `getFruits` function without passing a value as an argument, which means that `fruits` has a value of `undefined` by default. Since we're conditionally chaining the item on index `1` of`fruits`, it returns `undefined` since this item on index `1` does not exist. 

Lastly, we're trying to log the second item in the `['üçä', 'üçå']` subarray of `['üçç'], ['üçä', 'üçå']`. The item on index `1` within this subarray is `üçå`, which gets logged.

  Answer: A

We set the variable `calc` equal to a new instance of the `Calc` class. Then, we instantiate a new instance of `Calc`, and invoke the `increase` method on this instance. Since the count property is within the constructor of the `Calc` class, the count property is not shared on the prototype of `Calc`. This means that the value of count has not been updated for the instance calc points to, count is still `0`.

## 148. What's the output?

```javascript
const user = {
	email: "e@mail.com",
	password: "12345"
}

const updateUser = ({ email, password }) => {
	if (email) {
		Object.assign(user, { email })
	}

	if (password) {
		user.password = password
	}

	return user
}

const updatedUser = updateUser({ email: "new@email.com" })

console.log(updatedUser === user)
```

- A: `false`
- B: `true`
- C: `TypeError`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: B

The `updateUser` function updates the values of the `email` and `password` properties on user, if their values are passed to the function, after which the function returns the `user` object. The returned value of the `updateUser` function is the `user` object, which means that the value of updatedUser is a reference to the same `user` object that `user` points to. `updatedUser === user` equals `true`.

## 149. What's the output?

```javascript
const fruit = ['üçå', 'üçä', 'üçé']

fruit.slice(0, 1)
fruit.splice(0, 1)
fruit.unshift('üçá')

console.log(fruit)
```

- A: `['üçå', 'üçä', 'üçé']`
- B: `['üçä', 'üçé']`
- C: `['üçá', 'üçä', 'üçé']`
- D: `['üçá', 'üçå', 'üçä', 'üçé']`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

First, we invoke the `slice` method on the fruit array. The slice method does not modify the original array, but returns the value that it sliced off the array: the banana emoji.
Then, we invoke the `splice` method on the fruit array. The splice method does modify the original array, which means that the fruit array now consists of `['üçä', 'üçé']`.
At last, we invoke the `unshift` method on the `fruit` array, which modifies the original array by adding the provided value, ‚Äòüçá‚Äô in this case,  as the first element in the array.  The fruit array now consists of `['üçá', 'üçä', 'üçé']`.

## 150. What's the output?

```javascript
const animals = {};
let dog = { emoji: 'üê∂' }
let cat = { emoji: 'üêà' }

animals[dog] = { ...dog, name: "Mara" }
animals[cat] = { ...cat, name: "Sara" }

console.log(animals[dog])
```

- A: `{ emoji: "üê∂", name: "Mara" }`
- B: `{ emoji: "üêà", name: "Sara" }`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: B

Object keys are converted to strings. 

Since the value of  `dog` is an object,  `animals[dog]` actually means that we‚Äôre creating a new property called `"object Object"` equal to the new object. `animals["object Object"]` is now equal to `{ emoji: "üê∂", name: "Mara"}`.

`cat` is also an object, which means that `animals[cat]` actually means that we‚Äôre overwriting the value of  `animals[``"``object Object``"``]` with the new cat properties. 

Logging `animals[dog]`, or actually `animals["object Object"]` since converting the `dog` object to a string results `"object Object"`, returns the `{ emoji: "üêà", name: "Sara" }`.

## 151. What's the output?

```javascript
const user = {
	email: "my@email.com",
	updateEmail: email => {
		this.email = email
	}
}

user.updateEmail("new@email.com")
console.log(user.email)
```

- A: `my@email.com`
- B: `new@email.com`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: A

The `updateEmail` function is an arrow function, and is not bound to the `user` object. This means that the `this` keyword is not referring to the `user` object, but refers to  the global scope in this case. The value of `email` within the `user` object does not get updated. When logging the value of `user.email`, the original value of `my@email.com` gets returned.

## 152. What's the output?

```javascript
const promise1 = Promise.resolve('First')
const promise2 = Promise.resolve('Second')
const promise3 = Promise.reject('Third')
const promise4 = Promise.resolve('Fourth')

const runPromises = async () => {
	const res1 = await Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
	const res2  = await Promise.all([promise3, promise4])
	return [res1, res2]
}

runPromises()
	.then(res => console.log(res))
	.catch(err => console.log(err))
```

- A: `[['First', 'Second'], ['Fourth']]`
- B: `[['First', 'Second'], ['Third', 'Fourth']]`
- C: `[['First', 'Second']]`
- D: `'Third'`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: D

The `Promise.all` method runs the passed promises in parallel. If one promise fails, the `Promise.all` method _rejects_ with the value of the rejected promise. In this case, `promise3` rejected with the value `"Third"`. We‚Äôre catching the rejected value in the chained `catch` method on the `runPromises` invocation to catch any errors  within the `runPromises` function. Only `"Third"` gets logged, since `promise3` rejected with this value.

## 153. What should the value of `method` be to log `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`? 

```javascript
const keys = ["name", "age"]
const values = ["Lydia", 22]

const method = /* ?? */
Object[method](keys.map((_, i) => {
	return [keys[i], values[i]]
})) // { name: "Lydia", age: 22 }
```

- A: `entries`
- B: `values`
- C: `fromEntries`
- D: `forEach`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

The `fromEntries` method turns a 2d array into an object. The first element in each subarray will be the key, and the second element in each subarray will be the value. In this case, we‚Äôre mapping over the `keys` array, which returns an array which first element is the item on the key array on the current index, and the second element is the item of the values array on the current index. 

This creates an array of subarrays containing the correct keys and values, which results in `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`

## 154. What's the output?

```javascript
const createMember = ({ email, address = {}}) => {
	const validEmail = /.+\@.+\..+/.test(email)
	if (!validEmail) throw new Error("Valid email pls")

	return {
		email,
		address: address ? address : null
	}
}

const member = createMember({ email: "my@email.com" })
console.log(member)
```

- A: `{ email: "my@email.com", address: null }`
- B: `{ email: "my@email.com" }`
- C: `{ email: "my@email.com", address: {} }`
- D: `{ email: "my@email.com", address: undefined }`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: C

The default value of `address` is an empty object `{}`. When we set the variable `member` equal to the object returned by the `createMember` function, we didn't pass a value for address, which means that the value of address is the default empty object `{}`. An empty object is a truthy value, which means that the condition of the `address ? address : null` conditional returns `true`. The value of address is the empty object `{}`.

## 155. What's the output?

```javascript
let randomValue = { name: "Lydia" }
randomValue = 23

if (!typeof randomValue === "string") {
	console.log("It's not a string!")
} else {
	console.log("Yay it's a string!")
}
```

- A: `It's not a string!`
- B: `Yay it's a string!`
- C: `TypeError`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

  Answer: B

The condition within the `if` statement checks whether the value of `!typeof randomValue` is equal to `"string"`. The `!` operator converts the value to a boolean value. If the value is truthy, the returned value will be `false`, if the value is falsy, the returned value will be `true`. In this case, the returned value of `typeof randomValue` is the truthy value `"number"`, meaning that the value of `!typeof randomValue` is the boolean value `false`.

`!typeof randomValue === "string"` always returns false, since we're actually checking `false === "string"`. Since the condition returned `false`, the code block of the `else` statement gets run, and `Yay it's a string!` gets logged.
