## Describe a table

#### To describe a table such as a column, type, modifiers of columns, etc., you use the following command

```
\d table_name

```

#### now see all created table by

select * from pg_catalog.pg_tables;
```

#### List users and their roles (To list all users and their assign roles, you use \du command

)

\du

### Command history (To display command history, you use the \s command.)

```
\s
```

If you want to save the command history to a file, you need to specify the file name followed the \s command as follows:

```
\s filename
```

### Execute psql commands from a file (In case you want to execute psql commands from a file, you use \i command as follows:)

```
\i filename
```

### Edit command in your own editor

It is very handy if you can type the command in your favorite editor. To do this in psql, you \e command. After issuing the command, psql will open the text editor defined by your EDITOR environment variable and place the most recent command that you entered in psql into the editor.

```
\e
```

After you type the command in the editor, save it, and close the editor, psql will execute the command and return the result.

### Quit psql

```
\q
```

necessary Library might need to be install for wotk with postgreSQL

```

```
